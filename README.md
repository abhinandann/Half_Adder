#  Design and Analysis of Half Adder using Transmission gates
### This repository presents the Design and implementation of Half Adder using transmission gates. Design of Half Adder circuit is done by using an Opensource EDA Tool called eSim, an Opensource Spice Simulator called ngspice and Sky130 PDK.

## 1.ABSTRACT

An adder is a digital circuit that performs addition of two binary numbers. Basically, adders are the part of Arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which is the processing part of a CPU. Adders are used, not only in ALU, but also in other parts of processors to calculate addresses, increment, decrement operators and many other similar operations. The main concern is to build half adder which is power efficient, energy efficient and uses less number of transistors. The proposed work shows implementation of Half Adder using Transmission gates.
